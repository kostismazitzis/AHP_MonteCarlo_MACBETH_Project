# AHP, Monte Carlo, and MACBETH Analysis Project
This repository contains implementations for decision-making methodologies, including AHP, Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, and MACBETH.

## Contents
1. **Part B: AHP Implementation**
   - File: `Μέρος_Β_Code.m`
   - Description: Implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in Octave, including priority calculations and consistency checks.

2. **Part C: Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis**
   - File: `Μέρος_Γ_Code.m`
   - Description: Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 iterations to study the impact of randomly excluding 5 experts from the decision-making group.

3. **Part D: MACBETH Implementation**
   - File: `Μέρος_Δ_Code.m`
   - Description: Implementation of the MACBETH methodology for multi-criteria decision analysis.

4. **Documentation**
   - File: `Report_it22065_Dede.pdf`
   - Description: Detailed explanation of the methods, process, and results.

## How to Run
- Open the `.m` files in MATLAB or Octave.
